This is a recompile of fsplit, as taken from the BSD 4.2 Lite
distribution found, e.g. on Walnut Creek CD-ROM or ftp sites
(ftp.cdrom.com).

fsplit splits a multi-routine Fortran file into individual files.


now:      ftp://ftp-os2.cdrom.com/os2/incoming/fsplit.zip
move to:  ftp://ftp-os2.cdrom.com/os2/dev32/fsplit.zip

now:      ftp://ftp-os2.nmsu.edu/incoming/fsplit.zip
move to:  ftp://ftp-os2.nmsu.edu/os2/dev32/fsplit.zip

The original source file, the diff file, and the source file for 
OS/2 are included. The only change needed was replacing a call to 
link() by one to rename(). Seems to do the trick.


fsplit requires emx09b to be installed in order to run. The emxrt.zip
runtime library can be found on the ftp sites mentioned above.
To install just unzip, put the executable in your path, and in case
you use man put the man page in your man/man1 directory.

As always -- no warranties of any form expressed or implied, you
use this at your own risk. See also the source code for further
copyright, usage, and related information.


Have fun.                                                     21-Apr-1996
