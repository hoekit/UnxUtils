.SH NAME
recode \- manual page for recode 3.4r
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B recode
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [ [\fICHARSET\fR]\fI | REQUEST \fR[\fIFILE\fR]... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Free `recode' converts files between various character sets and surfaces.
.PP
If a long option shows an argument as mandatory, then it is mandatory
for the equivalent short option also.  Similarly for optional arguments.
.SS "Listings:"
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR[=\fIFORMAT\fR]
list one or all known charsets
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-known\fR=\fIPAIRS\fR
restrict charsets according to known PAIRS list
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-header[\fR=\fI[LN\fR/]NAME]
write table NAME on stdout using LN, then exit
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-freeze\-tables\fR
write out a C module holding all tables
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-find\-subsets\fR
report all charsets being subset of others
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-copyright\fR
display Copyright and copying conditions
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR

.SS "Operation modes:"
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
explain sequence of steps and report progress
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR

.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
force recodings even when not reversible
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-touch\fR
touch the recoded files after replacement
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-sequence\fR=\fIfiles\fR
use intermediate files for sequencing passes
.TP
\fB\-\-sequence\fR=\fImemory\fR
use memory buffers for sequencing passes
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-sequence\fR=\fIpipe\fR
use pipe machinery for sequencing passes
.SS "Fine tuning:"
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-strict\fR
use strict mappings, even loose characters
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-diacritics\fR
convert only diacritics or alike for HTML/LaTeX
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-source\fR[=\fILN\fR]
limit recoding to strings and comments as for LN
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-colons\fR
use colons instead of double quotes for diaeresis
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-graphics\fR
approximate IBMPC rulers by ASCII graphics
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\fR=\fICHARSET\fR
ignore CHARSET while choosing a recoding path
.PP
Option -l with no FORMAT nor CHARSET list available charsets and surfaces.
FORMAT is `decimal', `octal', `hexadecimal' or `full' (or one of `dohf').
Unless DEFAULT_CHARSET is set in environment, CHARSET defaults to `Latin-1'.
LN is some language, it may be `c', `perl' or `po'; `c' is the default.
.PP
REQUEST is SUBREQUEST[,SUBREQUEST]...; SUBREQUEST is ENCODING[..ENCODING]...
ENCODING is [CHARSET][/[SURFACE]]...; REQUEST often looks like BEFORE..AFTER,
with BEFORE and AFTER being charsets.  An omitted CHARSET implies the usual
charset; an omitted [/SURFACE]... means the implied surfaces for CHARSET; a /
with an empty surface name means no surfaces at all.  See the manual.
.PP
If none of -i and -p are given, presume -p if no FILE, else -i.
Each FILE is recoded over itself, destroying the original.  If no
FILE is specified, then act as a filter and recode stdin to stdout.
