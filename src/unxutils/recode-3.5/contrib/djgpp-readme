This is a port of GNU Recode 3.4 to MSDOS/DJGPP.

Installation
============

Just unzip the binary distribution from the top DJGPP installation
directory, If you aren't familiar with the package, read the info docs.
If you run the programs from plain DOS (not Windows), you will need
to install a DPMI host.  A free DPMI host is available as csdpmi3b.zip
from the peer directory ../v2misc at the same place you got the recode
package from.  Note that the man pages are not included in the binary
distribution, since they are no longer maintained by the GNU project;
use the Info documentation instead.

Features
========

This package has already been ported to the MSODS environment with Borland
Turbo C as the target compiler.  This made the porting process to DJGPP
extremely simple.

The file DIFFS in the source distribution describes the changes against
the original package.

The GNU Gettext package is supported in the ported version, so you could
expect the programs to talk to you in any language not just English.

Required tools
==============

If you want to recompile the package, you will need the DJGPP development
environment (GCC, header files and the libraries) and DJGPP ports of the
following tools:

	- GNU Make 3.75 or later
	- Bash (or some other Unix-like shell)
	- GNU Sed
	- GNU Fileutils
	- GNU Textutils
	- GNU Sh-utils
	- GNU Grep (only if you need to run DJGPP\CONFIG.BAT)
	- GNU Diffutils (only if you run the test suite)
	- Perl (only if you need to change the test scripts)

These should be available from the DJGPP sites.  There are a few more
programs invoked during the build process, but they are all part of a
standard DJGPP installation and should be already installed on your system.

The package should be built with the latest port of Make 3.75.  Previous
versions of Make ported to DJGPP didn't support Unix shells, and the
Makefiles for this package won't work without a Unix shell.


How to build
============

Unzip the distribution.  The package is already configured for DJGPP
v2.01, so if you only want to compile it, just call BUILD.BAT from the
main subdirectory:

		build

This invokes Make.  When Make finishes, you can install the package:

		make install

If you make a change in some of the programs, it is a good idea to run
the test suite, so you know you didn't break anything:

		make check

This will run for a while and should print 'All checks completed
successfully' after all tests have been performed.

If you build Recode with DJGPP release other than 2.01, or if you want
to change the configuration options (e.g. add National Language Support
once it becomes available), you will have to reconfigure the package.
The CONFIG.BAT batch file sets a few environment variables, then calls
BASH to run the configure script, so you should run CONFIG.BAT, then make:

		config
		make

The configure script run by CONFIG.BAT supports a few options.  Run "sh
./configure --help" to see all the options recognized by the script.


How to patch the original source
================================

You need the original sources of the GNU recode-3.4.1 package.
Ungzip and untar the sources, they'll be located in the directory named
'recode-3.4.1'.  Change the name of that directory to 'recode.341', and
create and empty directory named 'recode-3.4.1'.  In the parent directory
place the files 'update.bat' and 'diffs'.  Run update bat, this will
patch the original sources now located in 'recode.341' producing ready to
compile sources.  Remove files, whose names start with '`' and delete the
'recode-3.4.1' direcory.


Example of use
==============

To figure it out how to use Recode a sample PLCONV.BAT file is provided.
This file shows how to convert a file from IBM 852 code page to ISO 8859-2
code page.  Further details could be found in the Info documentation file.
