This manual 
page documents the GNU version of <B>su</B>. <B>su</B> allows one user to temporarily 
become another user.  It runs a shell with the real and effective user 
ID, group ID, and supplemental groups of USER.  If no USER is given, the 
default is root, the super-user. The shell run is taken from USER's password 
entry, or /bin/sh if none is specified there.  If USER has a password, 
<B>su</B> prompts for the password unless run by a user with real user ID 0 (the 
super-user). <P>
By default, <B>su</B> does not change the current directory.  It sets 
the environment variables `HOME' and `SHELL' from the password entry for USER, 
and if USER is not the super-user, sets `USER' and `LOGNAME' to USER.  By default, 
the shell is not a login shell. <P>
If one or more ARGs are given, they are 
passed as additional arguments to the shell. <P>
<B>su</B> does not handle /bin/sh 
or other shells specially (setting argv[0] to "-su", passing -c only to 
certain shells, etc.). <P>
On systems that have syslog, <B>su</B> can be compiled to 
report failed, and optionally successful, <B>su</B> attempts using syslog. <P>
This 
program does not support a "wheel group" that restricts who can <B>su</B> to 
super-user accounts, because that can help fascist system administrators 
hold unwarranted power over other users.  
<H3><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3">Options </A></H3>

<DL>

<DT><I>-c COMMAND, --command=COMMAND</I> 
 </DT>
<DD>Pass COMMAND, a single command line to run, to the shell with a <I>-c</I> option 
instead of starting an interactive shell. </DD>

<DT><I>-f, --fast</I>  </DT>
<DD>Pass the <I>-f</I> option to 
the shell.  This probably only makes sense with <B>csh</B> and <B>tcsh</B>, for which 
the <I>-f</I> option prevents reading the startup file (.cshrc).  With Bourne-like 
shells, the <I>-f</I> option disables filename pattern expansion, which is not 
a generally desirable thing to do. </DD>

<DT><I>--help</I>  </DT>
<DD>Print a usage message on standard 
output and exit successfully. </DD>

<DT><I>-, -l, --login</I>  </DT>
<DD>Make the shell a login shell. 
 This means the following.  Unset all environment variables except `TERM', 
`HOME', and `SHELL' (which are set as described above), and `USER' and `LOGNAME' 
(which are set, even for the super-user, as described above), and set `PATH' 
to a compiled-in default value.  Change to USER's home directory.  Prepend 
"-" to the shell's name, to make it read its login startup file(s). </DD>

<DT><I>-m, -p, 
--preserve-environment</I>  </DT>
<DD>Do not change the environment variables `HOME', `USER', 
`LOGNAME', or `SHELL'.  Run the shell given in the environment variable `SHELL' 
instead of USER's shell from /etc/passwd, unless the user running <B>su</B> is 
not the superuser and USER's shell is restricted.  A restricted shell is 
one that is not listed in the file /etc/shells, or in a compiled-in list 
if that file does not exist.  Parts of what this option does can be overridden 
by <I>--login</I> and <I>--shell</I>. </DD>

<DT><I>-s, --shell shell</I>  </DT>
<DD>Run SHELL instead of USER's shell from 
/etc/passwd, unless the user running <B>su</B> is not the superuser and USER's 
shell is restricted. </DD>

<DT><I>--version</I>  </DT>
<DD>Print version information on standard output 
then exit successfully. </DD>
