TODO file for GNU sharutils

Tell <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca> if you feel like volunteering for any
of these ideas, listed more or less in decreasing order of priority.

* Short term
  - include mail-files and mailshar from remsync
  - convert uucode documentation into sharutils.texi
  - better integrate uucode with the others, code-wise
  - remove many fixed limits, everywhere
  - delete useless code, among which some matching features
  - simplify further `:' vs `true' usage, the latter might be avoided

* Medium term
  - integrate remsync script and documentation
  - have -C as synonymous for -d in shar
	1994-08-22, Karl Berry <kb@cs.umb.edu>
  - speedup unshar, far too slow while matching sed input
  - construct some `make check' for shar/unshar
  - do something sensible with file permissions
  - study if the symbolic links might be transported
  - when local/remote directories are relative, this should be to ~user
  - do not send absolute files
  - add some `-h UNSHAR.HDR' option
	1994-08-19, Marty Leisner <leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com>
  - decode options from a SHAR environment variable
	1994-08-30, Ulrich Drepper <drepper@ira.uka.de>

* Long term
  - automatically retrieve in correct sequence from a bunched file
	1994-08-24, Karl Berry <kb@cs.umb.edu>
  - when -T, just reject binary files
	1994-08-29, Andrew A. Chernov <ache@astral.msk.su>
	1994-09-11, Eric Backus <ericb@lsid.hp.com> -- disagrees
