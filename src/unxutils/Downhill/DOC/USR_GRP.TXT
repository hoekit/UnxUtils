All the user and group UNIX routines included in the Downhill Project
are currently written to be compatible with Win32s, so they don't take
advantage of Windows NT's multi-user ability.

In other words, they're faked, and faked bad.

User and group information is controlled by the following global
variables:

	char* Downhill_User_Name
	uid_t Downhill_User_IdReal
	uid_t Downhill_User_IdEffective
	uid_t Downhill_User_IdSaved
	char* Downhill_User_Password
	char* Downhill_User_Gecos
	char* Downhill_User_Dir
	char* Downhill_User_Shell
	char* Downhill_Group_Name
	gid_t Downhill_Group_IdReal
	gid_t Downhill_Group_IdEffective
	gid_t Downhill_Group_IdSaved
	char* Downhill_Group_Password

By changing the values of these variables, you control what the various
user and group routines return.  Yes, it's ugly.  But it works.  Or,
rather, it works enough.

Eventually, these routines will be expanding to use NT's abilities, but
that's still a ways off.  If you want to give it a stab, feel free,
but be sure to leave the current functionality in so Win32s can still
use them.
